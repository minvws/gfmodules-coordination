# Qualification Register

## Introduction

The qualification register makes it possible to make a selection of healthcare providers
who are qualified for specific information standards. This can be used as a step in the
localization process to make an initial selection of where information about a patient
for a specific care context, also called the exchange, can be found.

## Design

The qualification register is split up in two main parts:

- The register
- The administration portal

The current setup only supplies an API for a future portal to be built.
The API including the database model and documentation can be found at the
[qualification-register](https://github.com/minvws/nl-irealisatie-zmodules-qualification-register)
repository.
