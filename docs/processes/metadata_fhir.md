# Metadata FHIR interface

## Summary

This process describes how a healthcare client application can fetch the metadata from a Localization Metadata Register.
At this stage, the only supported resource is [FHIR ImaginStudy](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/imagingstudy.html).
However, further resources would be added in consultation with other parties in the field.
